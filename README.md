# Optimizing Emotional Intelligence Assessment Methods in Intelligent Education Systems Using EEG Signals

## Overview

This repository contains resources, code, and data for the project **"Optimizing Emotional Intelligence Assessment Methods in Intelligent Education Systems Using EEG Signals"**. This research explores the integration of EEG signal analysis into intelligent education systems to enhance the assessment of Emotional Intelligence (EI). By leveraging real-time EEG data, the project aims to create dynamic and adaptive learning environments that respond to students' emotional states, improving academic performance, well-being, and social development.

## Abstract

Traditional methods of assessing Emotional Intelligence (EI) often rely on subjective techniques, such as self-reporting and observation, which lack real-time applicability. This project introduces a novel approach to optimize EI assessment in intelligent education systems using EEG signals. By analyzing brainwave patterns with advanced signal processing methods, this model captures neural correlates of emotional intelligence. These insights are integrated into intelligent education platforms to foster dynamic, responsive learning environments. Preliminary results validate the approach, demonstrating improved EI assessment accuracy and actionable data for personalized educational interventions. This research underscores the transformative potential of EEG-driven EI assessment in enhancing educational outcomes and student development.
